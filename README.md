# Hard_Hat_HelmetDetection

The goal of this object detection is to detect a hard-hat/construction helmet In many factory environments, when employees enter a designated area, they must be wearing proper  equipment such as a construction helmet. 
This project shows a solution which can be used to issue an alert when an employee has been detected and is not wearing a helmet in a designated area.
